# MM-CLF
A MultiModel Classification framework.

## Framework：
The framework includes three aspects：  
1.Text feature representation  
2.Image feature representation  
3.Modality fusion  

In this framework, the Text Feature Representation module and Image Feature Representation module allow for the free selection of different feature encoders to obtain suitable combinations of feature encoders. Additionally, it is possible to flexibly adjust the modality fusion strategy to effectively capture interactions between different modalities and reduce redundant information during model training. This framework uses frozen text encoders and image encoders, only propagating back the loss generated by the modality fusion module to update parameters.
